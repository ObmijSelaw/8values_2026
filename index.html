<h2>What is 8values?</h2>
    <p>8values is, in essence, a communally-developed, open-source political quiz that seeks to measure and classify a person’s political standpoint according to eight key political values, corresponding to two opposing principles in four axis or areas of politics. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, the your responses are used to calculate a score for each of the eight values. The resulting combination of the different values is the signature of your political ideology. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What's new in the 2026 Edition?</h2>
    <p>The original 8values test was developed around 2017 and, over the last nine years, many political issues not covered by the original test have become more salient. </p>
    <p>Various items in the previous version were found to be overly ambiguous or given improper "weights". Many of the sentences in the test have been rephrased or replaced outright to ensure more clarity, focusing more in concrete policy and, especially, contemporary cultural debates. </p>
    <p>The ideology database has also been overhauled. The previous version of 8values was too granular regarding the diverse variants of communist and anarchist ideologies, and not enough on the rest. With this update, we attempt to be more transparent regarding the limitations of the quiz, and the number of ideologies in the database has been reduced from 52 to 31.</p>
    <p>However, we have also added new ideologies that are prominent in today's social landscape that were not included in previous revisions. Please feel free to check the GitHub link top-right to see exactly all questions and ideologies changed. Or just take the test!</p>

<h2>Why is the left vs. right spectrum obsolete?</h2>
  <p>The left-right spectrum originated during the French Revolution, where those who supported the revolution sat on the left, and those who supported the monarchy sat on the right in the National Assembly. However, this distinction did not account for other dimensions of political ideology, such as economic, social, or cultural issues. As politics became more complex and diverse over time, so has the left-right spectrum become more inadequate and unsatisfactory Nowadays, the terms left-wing and right-wing are used mostly for rhetorical or propagandist purposes and its definition varies depending on the perspective.</p>
  <p>Many different ideologues and leaders who are ostensibly in the same side of the spectrum ("left" or "right") have actually strongly disagreed with other individuals and groups who have been labelled the same way. Also, this simplistic framework has proved useful, not for understanding or classifying the ideas of the many intellectual and political leaders, but to portray a caricature and strawman of real or perceived enemies without engaging the concrete proposals and tenets of any particular leader or movement.</p>
  <p>Proposals for alternative spectrums have been called for by some political scientists and political leaders, such as Andrew Heywood, David Boaz, David Nolan and Tony Blair, among others. Another contention point regarding the *left vs. right* dichotomy is their variability depending on time and place. For instance, *classical liberalism* is commonly thought of today as a right-wing or right-leaning ideology, but at the time of its original development it was simply known as "liberalism" and was categorised as a form of left-wing politics, in contrast to right-wing politics, which was understood as monarchism.
  <p>Robert Rohrschneider and Stephen Whitefield in their paper *Understanding Cleavages in Party Systems: Issue Position and Issue Salience in 13 Post-Communist* pointed another example: in many Western European and American democracies, traditionally the left is associated with socially liberal and economically "left" values, while the right is traditionally associated with socially conservative and economically "right" values, Eastern European, post-communist parties are frequently juxtaposed, with economically left parties holding nationalist positions more frequently and economically right parties being liberal and internationalist.</p>
  <p>Several of the most popular political tests out there were made more than 15 years ago, usually in conjunction with specific elections or focused on issues that concern only a few regions or countries in the world, limiting its usefulness.</p>

<h2>The Eight Values model</h2>
  <p>One alternative framework is the present *8values* test. "TristanBomb", a developer on GitHub created the first version of this open-source political quiz around April 2017. Shortly after the initial commits, volunteer users were asked to take the quiz, share their scores and self-declared ideology to develop its ideological matching feature, which, to this day, is still unique among political identification tests.</p>
  <p>The *8values* became popular around the same time, with users from many countries and regions, including the U.S, Canada, Australia, Western and Eastern Europe, Japan, and Latin America sharing their results on social media such as 4chan and Twitter.</p>
<p>While the 8-values test, like any political quiz, is subject to limitations—such as potential biases in question phrasing or the challenge of reducing complex ideologies to numerical scores—its open-source development, extensive ideological database, and enduring popularity make it a robust tool for understanding the political landscape at home and abroad.</p>
  <p>With its four axes and ideology database, 8values offers a more nuanced identification compared to previous political alignment tests such as the Political Compass or the Nolan Chart, where all ideological groups are condensed into two axes forming four blocks or quadrants. On the other hand, tests such as 9Axis or Six Triangles add too much granularity and lose the ideological matching feature.</p>
  
<h2><a id="anchor">What are the eight values?</a></h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Economic, Diplomatic, Civil, and Society - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 17pt;">What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send us an email at eightvalues@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
